# Advanced_Css_PortfolioThis is an exercise in refactoring an existing website for the Horiseon company.

The primary goal for this exercise was to create a responsive portfolio website from scratch using advanced CSS following these guidelines:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Given that, at this time, I do not have enough projects to do the project justice the "work" cards that I have created highlite a little about who I am and what I enjoy. They are tongue in cheek and should not be taken as real in each case.
